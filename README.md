# End-to-End Credit Card Fraud Detection
data source : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud

This project is an **end-to-end machine learning pipeline** for detecting credit card fraud. It includes **data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and an interactive Streamlit app** for predictions.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

Credit card fraud is a highly imbalanced problem. This project tackles it with the following key features:

- **Data Imbalance Handling**: Over-sampling, under-sampling, and custom sampling strategies.
- **Models**: XGBoost & Random Forest for robust fraud prediction.
- **Custom Threshold Selection**: Optimized for F1-score to reduce false negatives.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Modular functions, OOP design, and config-driven workflow.
- **Logging System**: Tracks all training and evaluation steps.
- **Interactive App**: Streamlit app to upload transaction CSVs and get labeled predictions.
